# User Story Mapping Practice

This folder contains material related to Lab 1, where we were asked to plan out our semester using Stories on Board.

## Extra Feature
The extra feature I used was color coding the cards based on the recurrance of the task. 

All tasks which will be completed on a nearly daily basis are blue.
All tasks which will be compelted weekly are purple.
All tasks which will be completed only once are orange.
